- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sherman
- 👀 I’m interested in learning programming and reading.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python! Doing my 100days of code on udemy currently. (probably way more than 100days due to my line of work)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on - nothing, just a newbie learning how to code and trying to take in as much things as possible :)
- 📫 How to reach me - shermantaymk@gmail.com
